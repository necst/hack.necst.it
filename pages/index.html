                Badass students doing things on their PCs? Check. Soulless coding monkeys solving security challenges?
                Check. Handsome Italian guys better than Gordon Ramsey? Check. Perfectly and lovely written write-ups? Check. Sounds perfect.
                Tower of Hanoi (also known as Hanoiati) is the Politecnico di Milano CTF team.

                Cool... but what is a CTF?
                CTFs (Capture The Flag) are information security competitions, aimed at teaching how to find, exploit and patch security vulnerabilities and, in turn, how to avoid vulnerabilities when writing software.

                The Sport and Wellness Hackathon is a 48 hours' event organized by NECST Laboratory in partnership with Iterpro,
                an Italian startup aiming at filling the gap between practice and sports science,
                in order to turn data into action and help football clubs to make better decision faster.
            </p>
            <p>
                From November to January students will have the opportunity to learn how to use the main technology
                (hardware and software) that will be available during the hackathon.
                In February participants, will be selected into max 25 teams (max 5 students per team)
                and the hackathon will take place during the first weekend of March.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end of the hackathon each team will be asked to deliver the proof of concept of their project.
                5 selected teams will attend the final event at the end of May.
                The final event will take place at the headquarter of a very important sport company.
