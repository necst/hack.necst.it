            <p>
                Floorplanning is the process of choosing the best grouping and connectivity of logic in a design, and of manually placing blocks of logic in an FPGA, where the goal is to increase density, routability, or performance. The intent is to reduce route delays for selected logic by suggesting a better placement. A good floorplanning methodology can improve performance and help the placed and routed design meet timing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prof. Santambrogio and Prof. Miele, in the context of their PhD course “Advanced Topic on Heterogeneous Computing System” are organising, with Marco Rabozzi, the first Floorplanner Design Contest at Politecnico di Milano. Students attending the course are invited to participate, but participation is not mandatory.
            </p>
            <p>
                The design contest will open on the 6th of December and will close on the 19th of December. During this period of time, participants will have the chance to attend some special tutoring sessions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each project / entry for the contest has to be realized by a single participant.
