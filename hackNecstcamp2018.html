                    On October 27 and 28, the teams (composed by 3 students at maximum) will compete in a 48-hours hackathon at DEIB.<br/> From the hackathon to December, the 7 best teams will be selected to a second phase, where each team will be asked to work at NECSTLab with mentors working in the hackathon topics, to develop the Proof Of Concept implemented while attending the October hackathon.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The winning teams of the second phase, will be announced on December 21st and will be awarded with the opportunity of joining the NECST Group Conference (May 17 - June 2 @ San Francisco).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are interested in being part of the event, but you are not part of a team, you may want to join the Facebook Group “Hack@NECST” (https://www.facebook.com/groups/Hack.NECST/) and in posting your message there to convince other in joining you!

                <p>
                    <strong>The PIs developed during the hackthon will remain to the participants.</strong><br/>
                    If interested, as part of the PEoPLE@DEIB in the Passion in Action initiative, you may be willing to explore two possibilities, but the ones provide by this hackathon itself:<br/>
                    . IEEE RTSI (in Sept 2019, in Florence) by submitting either a scientific paper or a Demo to the IEEE Young Professional Contest<br/>
                    . Switch 2 Product by submitting business idea to this PoliMi competition.<br/>
                    Moreover, if interested in these opportunities, we would like to remind you that in the PEoPLe@DEIB initiative we do have several courses that may be of interest for you, e.g.:<br/>
                    . StartUp 101: <a href="https://www.polimi.it/?id=8936&corso=7" target="_blank">https://www.polimi.it/?id=8936&corso=7</a><br/>

                    EVALUATION AND AWARDS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Participants will be requested to:<br/>
                    - develop a proof of concept of their idea during the hackathon to prove that they have the necessary skills to carry on the development during the second phase<br/>
                    - validate their idea from a user’s point of view. It’ll be important to be able to prove that the project will help the user to improve his/her experience<br/>
                    - provide, even if preliminary and bugged version, a basic dashboard to demonstrate the “admin” experience in being able to navigate the collected data from the users<br/>
                    - efficiently communicate the value and potentialities of their technical project
                    - be able to work in team, by having contributions from all the members<br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 7 best teams will be selected to a second phase, where each team will be asked to work at NECSTLab with mentors working in the hackathon topics, to develop an advanced version of their Proof Of Concept implemented while attending the October hackathon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The winners of the second phase, will be announced on December 21st and will be awarded with the opportunity of joining the NECST Group Conference (May 17 - June 2 @ San Francisco).
